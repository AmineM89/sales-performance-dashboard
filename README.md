# Sales Performance Dashboard

## Overview

This project highlights my **reporting and data visualization capabilities** through an interactive **Sales Performance Dashboard** built with **Excel** and **Power Pivot**. The dashboard is designed for tracking key sales metrics, comparing performance across different periods, and analyzing the contribution of various products and major events to overall revenue.

This repository includes a **video demonstration** showcasing the dashboard in action, along with a **screenshot** of the data model built using Power Pivot, illustrating my ability to construct data models from multiple sources.

## Disclaimer

The data used in this project has been replaced with randomly generated data, while maintaining the structure and coherence necessary to preserve the integrity of the displayed results. The goal is to retain the meaning of the analysis while ensuring the confidentiality of the real data. This approach demonstrates reporting and analysis capabilities without compromising the validity of the key metrics presented.

## Features

### 1. **Overview Panel**
   - Displays key **Year-to-Date (YTD)** metrics:
     - **Achievement rate** (actual vs target)
