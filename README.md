# Sales Performance Dashboard

## Overview

This project highlights my **reporting and data visualization capabilities** through an interactive **Sales Performance Dashboard** built with **Excel** and **Power Pivot**. The dashboard is designed for tracking key sales metrics, comparing performance across different periods, and analyzing the contribution of various products and major events to overall revenue.

This repository includes a **video demonstration** showcasing the dashboard in action, along with a **screenshot** of the data model built using Power Pivot, illustrating my ability to construct data models from multiple sources.

## Features

### 1. **Overview Panel**
   - Displays key **Year-to-Date (YTD)** metrics:
     - **Achievement rate** (actual vs target)
     - **Growth** compared to the previous period.
   - A bar chart highlights **monthly sales** for the **current year** and the **previous year**, along with a curve displaying **monthly targets**.
   - Filters for **product categories**, **dates**, and **regions** allow for customizable analysis.

### 2. **Yearly Comparison View**
   - Compares **current year** performance to the previous two years (**Y-1** and **Y-2**) on both a **YTD** and **monthly** basis.

### 3. **SKU Contribution Analysis**
   - Identifies **Top SKUs** contributing up to **90% of overall revenue**, with the ability to filter by **time period**, **region**, and **product family**.

### 4. **Event Panel**
   - A dynamic view displaying major events (e.g., **out of stock**, **price changes**, **special offers**) for any selected month, with an interactive timeline of monthly sales.
